# xinput-joystick-visualizer
Visualite the analog joysticks on any standard xinput controller. Useful for recording FPV freestyles in simulators.

## IMPORTANT: This was just a quick personal project. There are many things that can be added, but I cannot promise updates from me.
Currently only shows joystick movements. 
- Requires Python 3.10+. Please make sure you have ctypes (should be built in), sys (also should be built in), and pygame (pip install pygame) installed in your PATH.
- Download the source code and run xinputview.py.

- Use OBS window capture to include in your screenrecording or use Powertoys Always On Top to have be able to view it live while playing.

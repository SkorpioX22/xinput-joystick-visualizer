# xinput-joystick-visualizer
Visualite the analog joysticks on any standard xinput controller. Useful for recording FPV freestyles in simulators.

## IMPORTANT: This was just a quick personal project. There are many things that can be added, but I cannot promise updates from me.
Currently only shows joystick movements. 
Requires Python 3.10+. Please make sure you have ctypes (should be built in), sys (also should be built in), and pygame (pip install pygame) installed in your PATH.
Download the source code and run xinputview.py.
Use OBS window capture to include in your screenrecording or use Powertoys Always On Top to have be able to view it live while playing.
